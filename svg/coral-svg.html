        <h1>Coral External SVG sprite system</h1>
        <h3>The current state of the icons</h3>
        <p>The most updated icon set can be found <a href="https://danielcss.github.io/svg/demo/coral-verbose.html">here</a></p>
        <h3>A few issues/clarifications regarding the SVGs</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The newer icons (eg: 'General--Forms--Lock' in the above document) seem to be created differently than the initial icons.
            It is very important that the icons are created consitently. For instance, the initial icons all had a viewBox with width and height of 24.
            The newer icons have different viewBox values for width and height (eg: The 'Lock' icon above has: <code>viewBox="0 0 160 224"</code>).
            This creates problems when scaling the icons.
            Similarly, the thickness of the icons should also be consistent.
          </li>

          <li>The target SVG icons which should be included in the icon set should be light-weight 1-2 KB icons (give or take) which have the ability to change color
           (eg: if the background changes they need to 'invert' color). My point is that some of the 'legal'/'Payment_Methods' SVG icons - don't fit this description: they are very
           heavy (GibGobern - 77KB !! , Senet - 38 KB etc) and don't need to dynamically change color. These should probably be prepared as png sprites.
           (The file size of the pngs should be considerably smaller - especially after being compressed)
          </li>
          <li>Please create 2 folders of icons: One with all the icons which need to be able to change color dynamically (most of the icons) and another folder
            with icons which are colored and never change color - like the social icons. This will help me when preparing the icons in the format that I need them.
          </li>
          <li>Please try to create the SVGs as light-weight as possible. For instance the TRIATHLON.svg is 11KB, LACROSSE.svg is 10KB, FUTSAL.svg is 9KB whereas GAELIC_FOOTBALL.svg is only 3KB (??)
          maybe there are alternate ways to prepare these icons to make them smaller?
          </li>
          <li>Please leave a little bit of space near the edges, especially for round shapes.
          </li>
          <li>(Just to reiterate:) The SVG viewBox should be square and all icons should use the same viewBox dimensions (eg. viewBox="0 0 24 24" )</h3>
          </li>
        </ol>
