    <h1>Introduction to the Notification API</h1>
    <p>
      The Notifications API is the interface that browsers expose to the
      developer to allow showing messages to the user, with their permission,
      even if the web site / web app is not open in the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those messages are consistent and native, which means that the receiving
      person is used to the UI and UX of them, being system-wide and not
      specific to your site.
    </p>
    <p>
      In combination with the Push API this technology can be a successful way
      to increase user engagement and to enhance the capabilities of your app.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Notifications API interacts heavily with Service Workers, as they are
      required for Push Notifications. You can use the Notifications API without
      Push, but its use cases are limited.
